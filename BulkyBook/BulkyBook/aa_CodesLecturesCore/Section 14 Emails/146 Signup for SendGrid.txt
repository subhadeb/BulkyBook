We will be using SendGrid for Sending emails. 

And with SendGrid we can send upto 100 emails for free everyday.

In the portal
https://sendgrid.com/

Clicked Start For Free.

Was not able to create The account with gmail or hotmail account, as they expect it be of our own domain(Not so reputed like gmail/hotmail).

So signed up to hushmail.com for email.

Selected 16Chars password.

In Tell Us About Yourself, Gave the Name Company Details(as No company).

Get Started.

Now clicked Contact Support as they want more info.

Selected username as my fullname in small, email as the one of hushmail.

At the end they said request submitted successfully in toastr.

Initiall The request was sumbitted for Account Creation(Confirmed from email) and later the Account was activated(Confirmed from email).

In the next day I was able to login, it asked for phone number and verified that.

Now Under Send you first email 

Selected - Integrate Using Web API and SMTP Relay at Start.

Now Under Web API, selected Choose.

The selected C # Choose.

Selected Create an API Key as BulkyBook.

It gave a key, and copied the key.
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

Also at the bottom it provided code snipped for Execute.

 static async Task Execute()
        {
            var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_FOR_YOUR_SENDGRID_KEY");
            var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
            var from = new EmailAddress("test@example.com", "Example User");
            var subject = "Sending with SendGrid is Fun";
            var to = new EmailAddress("test@example.com", "Example User");
            var plainTextContent = "and easy to do anywhere, even with C#";
            var htmlContent = "<strong>and easy to do anywhere, even with C#</strong>";
            var msg = MailHelper.CreateSingleEmail(from, to, subject, plainTextContent, htmlContent);
            var response = await client.SendEmailAsync(msg);
        }




Now gone to Appsettings.json added SendGridKey as the big key, Also added SendGridUser as BulkyBook
