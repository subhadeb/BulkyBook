Now If we login as a registered user, we see a Profile. The Page is not in synch with the other pages. The layout is missing here it should have a list of tabs for Profile/Email/Password ....

He was saying this is a bug from Microsoft. 

Under Identity Area > Pages > Account > Manage we have _Layout.cshtml.

It is not having the same as his, I have an if else check he does not have it. but I will change the else block Layout to 
Layout = "/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";


Now copied _ViewStart.cshtml from the main account folder and Pasted in the Manage folder under Account. Opened it and here changed the Layout to only

@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}

Now if Refresh the Manage Page again, we see the list of tabls for Profile/Email...

Now there are many more options.

Once we create an account we can link our account with Gmail and Facebook. He linked google to his account and removed(I did not do it as of now)

If we want we can have More tabs here like Street address here. 

Next we have an option for Two-factor authentication(Fifth tab)

In order to do that clicked Add Authenticator app.

It was telling the steps to do that. From that clicked on the link for enable QR code generation. It opend Microsoft Docs and there we have like:

These instructions use qrcode.js from the https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/ repo.

Now opened https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/,
Downloaded the zip version.

Extracted to the folder davidshimjs-qrcodejs-04f46c6

From inside the folder, copied qrcode.js and pasted in wwwroot/js

In the portal it is already given as:
Follow the instructions in Scaffold Identity to generate /Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.
In /Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/EnableAuthenticator.cshtml, locate the Scripts section at the end of the file:

SO opened Identity areas Pages/Account/Manage/EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.

At the bottom in the script section, pasted the below codes copied from the portal and removed the line @await Html.PartialAsync("_ValidationScriptsPartial"). also changed the path for qrcode.js to ~/js/qrcode.js. Overall it's like:

@section Scripts {
    <partial name="_ValidationScriptsPartial" />

    <script type="text/javascript" src="~/js/qrcode.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        new QRCode(document.getElementById("qrCode"),
            {
                text: "@Html.Raw(Model.AuthenticatorUri)",
                width: 150,
                height: 150
            });
    </script>
}

On refreshing we see the QR code :)

He was saying we need ot download the Microsoft or google authenticator app and scan the qr code. After that we need to provide the verification code. After this from the next time we login we would need a code from authenticator app and only then we will be able to login.

He have shown demo from his mobile by entering some verification codes, enterd the verification codes in the website and on logging out and login again, It would ask Authentication code that was sent to Phone.

This is how Authenticator and two factor authentication are working together.
