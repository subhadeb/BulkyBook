Let's have a look at the project configuration file.


For opening the Project file we can right click on the Project(not the solution) and then select edit Project file or double click on the project. both will work.

The filename would be the project name with the extension .csproj.

The project file have been there since long but the format is different in asp.net core 3.

We have the targe framewordk netcoreapp3.1 in this project. 

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>



With time we would add more packages into our solution.

For demo he have installed Newtonsoft.json from nuget and we have seen that it got added to the csproj. We will delete the reference as well(later).

It got added as 


  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="12.0.3" />
  </ItemGroup>

Every time we add a new package a package is added here. 

Uninstalled the nuget. after showing.

Opened SLide.

Where's the Meta Package

Microsoft AspNetCoreApp was the metapackage which contained all features of .Net Core.

>>Prior to .Net Core 3, metapackage was included as a nuget package.


>> With .Net Core 3 onwards, meta package is part of .Net core installation itself so you donot have to include that in the project reference anymore.

Some packages like EFCore is now moved out of the metapackage. It has it's own nuget package which we will be using later.

So Metapackage is installed automatically.

So we have seen csproj is used for referencing the packages.
