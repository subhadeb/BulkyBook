Now we will see the Other Folders.

Now Opened HomeController from Controllers folder,

We can see the HomeController is inheriting Controller base class. And every controller should have the Name Controller at the end.


In Each controller we will have Action Methods. We can see we have the ActionMethods for Index, Privacy and Error.

IActionResult is an interface and it defines what would be the Result of an Action. It contains all the implementations, It can be a view/string/empty object etc. IActionResult has all the implemetaions that an Action would return.

Whenever we give an URL it hits the ActionMethod in the controller, For example for Index() At the end return View() means it will return the Index view.

We have the Index View in the Path. 
Views/Home/Index.cshtml

So ActionMethod will have a Corrosponding View in the Views Folder and this is a general flow of MVC Applicaitons. So For Privacy we have the Privacy View.

We can specify a different view if we pas some parameters and we will understand that later. So Every Controller will have ActionMethods.


We can have different Action Methods like Get/Post and For API we would have other action methods. If nothing is defined it is a get Action Method. 



Now in Models Folder, Right now we only Have ErrorViewModel.cs. We will see View Models later

For every entity/table  in the Database, we will have a corrosponding Model. All the Columns in the tables will be the Properties of the Class. We would be adding many models and view models in our course.



Now we have the Views Folder, Inside it we have the Home folder and it is mapped to the Home Controller. We will all the view of Home Controller here.

We have a Shared folder, The first one is _Layout, it is the Master page of the application. Everything that is common in the application like Header and Footers would be in the _Layout. Here we would also have the CSS and JS references that we would use through out our Applicaiton.


Currently in _Layout.css we can see in the head section we have Bootstrap and Css reference.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />


At the end we can see all the Javascript references that we want through out our application.


We can see we have <header> section that would be used for displaying the top elements of the page(screen page), and footer section will have the bottom elements of the page.

RenderBody() will render the contents of the other views. Like Index/Details etc.

In the header we can see like:
 <partial name="_LoginPartial" />

Whenver we will use a Partial View, we would use the partial tag. And in _LoginPartial we can see we have the Buttons for Login and Register. So in the Main layout we would have the links to Login and Register. 


In _ValidationScriptsPartial, we are adding the links to jquery validation. These are responsible for validating ModelState in the Client Side. We will use these in the future videos.

Next we have Error.cshtml for Errors and this is just a generic view. 

Next we have _ViewImports.cshtml and _ViewStart.cshtml. ViewImports is a file that is used to Import tag helpers. The below codes for area and controller in _Layout.cshtml, these are working because we are using @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers in the ViewImport. If we would have separate Areas for different views, We should use _ViewImports and _ViewStarts and import the tag helpers otherwise tag helpers will not work. If we have a custome tag helper we need to add that in _ViewImports. 

asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" 

Now in _ViewStart.cshtml we have

@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}


Here we define what is the Masterpage of the folder and the sub folders. We have defined that as _Layout. we can change that as well.

This a brief overview of the Models,Views and Controllers.
