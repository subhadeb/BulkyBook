In the Portal, Created new Repository BulkyBook

Made it Public.

Add .gitingore and selected temaplate as VisualStudio.

So the URL https://github.com/subhadeb/BulkyBook is available.


Now opened VS 2019.

Selected Clone a repository from the starting page.

In the Browse a repository clicked GitHub.

Popup came with all the projects.

I selected: 
subhadeb\BulkyBook

In the local path the below is selected.

C:\Users\subdeb\Source\Repos\subhadeb\BulkyBook

Clicked Clone.

Was able to see BulkyBook in the solution explorer with gitignore. To that added a new project.

Now Forget the Above and we would Freshly Create a New Project(We would only mapy the above directory to our project). Restart VS.

--Previous Part- Create Project Start
Now we will create the BulkyBook Project.

In VS Start Page Selecte Create a New Project, then selected ASP.NET Core Web Application, Next.

[Now The Linking to the Github folder folder]
Project Name: BulkyBook
Location(The Github folder): C:\Users\subdeb\Source\Repos\subhadeb\BulkyBook
Solution Name: BulkyBook

Now click Create Button.

Now in the Create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application Popup
We would be using .NET Core(Not .Net Framework)

We would be using ASP.NET Core 3.1

In the Right Under Authentication, Clicked Change, We would Select the Radio Button Individual User Account. It would automatically write the Code related to Authorization and would automatically Create Identity Tables for US. Pressed Ok.

Now the Type of Application would be Web Application(Model-View-Controller).

We will go with MVC because this our main focus in the Course(we would have created Empty Project or API as well).

Razor Projects are better for building Small Projects. For Large Projects, MVC is prefferred because of the Separation of Concern. 

Now Click Create Button. After the Project is Created we can see the Solution Explorer, Now we have Areas and Controllers Folder Automatically Created.

--Previous Part- Create Project End

In Program.cs Main method Commented like
//This is the Initial code at 10:45PM

Now Built the Solution.

In Team Explorer, In the changes all the files were visible.

Checked in and pushed the code.
