Now Moved ErrorViewModel to BulkyBook.Models Project.(Dragged and dropped and deleted from the Main Project). Deleted the Models Folder.

Now in BulkyBook.Models, Created a new Folder named ViewModels and Moved ErrorViewModel.cs inside that.

Updated the namespace to

namespace BulkyBook.Models.ViewModels

Now On Building we can see 6 Reference Errors.

Deleted all the unwanted References(Codes).
Example the First one was to remove the below from Startup.cs
using BulkyBook.Data;

[He did not do it]
The last error was for some version mismatch for Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore,

To fix that Opened Manage Nuget Packages, and then for the DataAccess project changed the version from 5.x to 3.1

After the errors are gone run the project and make sure it is working.

Also there was error in the file
Error.cshtml.g.cs

Fixed it by Changing the Reference to BulkyBook.Models.ViewModels.ErrorViewModel.

Now on running we see the Home and Privacy Working as earlier.

Now in the Utility project addd a Class file for Static Details named it SD.cs

After creation change the classname to 
public static class SD

Once again Build the project.

As The main project would be using all the three created prjects we need to add references to the three. 

Right click main project, 

Add Project Reference

Checked all the three projects.

Our Models would be using Data and Utility.

Now Right Click on DataAccess Project and Check the Projects Models and Utility.

Make sure we do not add any circular references.

We will continue filtering the project in the next part.
