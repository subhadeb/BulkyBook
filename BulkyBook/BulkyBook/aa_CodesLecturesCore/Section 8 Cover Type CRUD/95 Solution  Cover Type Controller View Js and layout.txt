I have seen the solution of the Assignment in 1.5x mode. and will be Coding it here taking the Github reference of his codes.

Add Controller by Renaming.
First Copy Paste CategoryController, open it and rename to CoverTypeController.cs

Now open it, Strl Shif F, For Find And Replace, Go to Replace in Files tab, Select the Match case checkbox, [*IMP*]Select Lookin as Current document[*IMP*] and Replace Category with CoverType--11 Occurences Replaced

Now, Replace category with coverType-- 10 Occurences Replaced

Inside it Replace All Category with CoverType using replace all select match case and then replace category with coverType.

Now In Views, copy paste the Folder Category and Rename to CoverType.

Open Index.cshtml, then Ctrl + F for Category and then Rename to Covertype/covertype in all the paces mantaining the casing. The js script reference name would be coverType.js

Done the same thing for Upsert.cshtml

Now copy paste category.js and rename to coverType.js

Opened it, 
Control + F on Category rename to CoverType based on the casing.

go to _Layout add a link as a dropdown-item, the Controller name is CoverType
<a class="dropdown-item" asp-area="Admin" asp-controller="CoverType" asp-action="Index">Cover Type</a>

Now on running we see Everything Running as usual(CRUD).
