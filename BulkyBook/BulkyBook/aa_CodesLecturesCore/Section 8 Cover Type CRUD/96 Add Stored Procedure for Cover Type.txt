As of NOw we are using EF for our operations, what if we would like to Use Stored Procedure.

We can create the SPs in the Database, but this would be a bad idea comparing with our Code First approach.

So FOr that we would create stored procedures in our codes.

Open PM Console, Select the Default Project.

PM> add-migration AddStoredPracForCoverType

This will create an empty migration. We will write the codes in that migration. to create store procedure.

Two methods are creted now:
        protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
        {

        }

        protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
        {

        }

In the Up method we can write like:
migrationBuilder.Sql(@"");

In the double quotes we will write the sql commands for the sps.
He did not write here from scratch, these are simple get/insert/update/delete query. He added an attachment for this: Stored+Proc+Script+Cover+Type.txt

It has CREATE SCRIPT and Drop Script,

From CREATE SCRIPT, copy pasted all the migrationBuilder Codes. These are five in total.

The first SP usp_GetCoverTypes simply selects all CoverTypes.

With usp_GetCoverType, we get the details based on id.

usp_UpdateCoverType it updates the name.

usp_DeleteCoverType removes based on the id.

usp_CreateCoverType is for inserting.

These are all simple queries. We only need to remember migration builder inserts SQL Commands.

Down() method is dropping the procedures if something goes down. so pasted all his attached codes for DROP DATABASE.

migrationBuilder.Sql(@"DROP PROCEDURE usp_GetCoverTypes");
migrationBuilder.Sql(@"DROP PROCEDURE usp_GetCoverType");
migrationBuilder.Sql(@"DROP PROCEDURE usp_UpdateCoverType");
migrationBuilder.Sql(@"DROP PROCEDURE usp_DeleteCoverType");
migrationBuilder.Sql(@"DROP PROCEDURE usp_CreateCoverType");

Now built the solution.

In SQL server check what procedures are available currently.

SELECT * from sys.procedures

The above dont show any sp.

Now run the below in PM console in BuilkyBook.DataAccess Default project:

PM> update-database

Now on running
SELECT * from sys.procedures

We see five sps. And we can execute getCoverTypes like:

exec usp_GetCoverTypes

it gives us the id and name.
