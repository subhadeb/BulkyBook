Opened kind of PPT saying

"We all need people who will give us feedback, That's how we improve"

We was saying he hoped we liked the course so far. If we want we can message him. He recommend to give review.

We can edit the review.

And he opened Udemy to show how to give review. 

he have shown how we can edit the rating.


These reviews are of great importance to him.

We will get back to coding in the next part.
