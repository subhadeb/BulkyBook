Although we have separated the Projected by creating two more but our controllers/Views will become too cumbersome if we would add too many of them.

Our Application has two main broad parts
Customer: Customer Facing Website
Admin: Manage the Content that The Website displays.

It would be nice if we would mantain Areas for these two.

Currently in the Areas folder we have One Folder Identity, It got created because We Selected Individual Users Account while creating the Application.

Now Controllers Folder is having the HomeController and Views have Home folder for HomeController Action Methods.

Now in the Areas folder, Add New Area Name it Customer, Add

After it is Added we can see ScaffoldingReadMe.txt is opened. It is asking to change the routes.

We can also see the Customer Area is created with the folders Controllers, Data,Models, Views.

From ScaffoldingReadMe.txt copied 
template : "{area:exists}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"

Opened Startup.cs in app.UseEndPoints we can see the pattern is like:
pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

With areas the above should change to incorporate area like:

pattern: "{area=Customer}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");


Now we will move the HomeController to the Customer to make it work.

First Remove the Data and Models Folder in the Customer as we have separate projects for these.

Now Removed HomeController form Controllers folder to Customer>Controllers under Areas.

Now Opened HomeController and we need to specify the Area Attribute so to the HomeController class, added the attribute 
[Area("Customer")]

Also to Note, whenever we will add a new controller to this Controllers folder under an Area, we need to add the Attribute for Area.

Now Drag the Home Folder From Views of the Main Project to the Views folder under Areas(Customer).

Now Opened HomeController, we will change the Namespace to the updated path now it would be.

namespace BulkyBook.Areas.Customer.Controllers

Now on running he got the errors which I already got in the last part. He Resolved them by Adding References/ Updating the New Path in the errors.

pattern: "{area=Customer}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

Now After running, There no webpage Local host error was coming after multiple hit and tries(Restart/New Controller Created and Deleted in Areas), I was able to resolve the error. There was no specific fix for this.
