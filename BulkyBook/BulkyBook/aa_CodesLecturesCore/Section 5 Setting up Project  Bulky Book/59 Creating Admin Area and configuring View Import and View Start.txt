On Running we did not see the Layout or Master Page, The reason is we have moved views in the areas but our masterpage is defined in _ViewStart.cshtml.

So copied the two files from Views of Main Project to the Views of Customer Area.

_ViewImports.cshtml
_ViewStart.cshtml

Now opened _ViewStart.cshtml under Areas, and changed the Layout to
Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";

So we are keeping the _Layout at a global level and not moving it inside areas.

Also we will not move the Shared partial views from the main project to the areas. We will keep them global.

Now on running. The Layout is again Visible.

Now Lets add the Admin area(similar to the way we created Customer Area).

Now again we are able to see the folders- Controllers,Data,Models and Views under Admin.

Now again deleted the folders Data and Models.

Now copied the below to from the Views of Customer Area to Views of Admin Area

_ViewImports.cshtml
_ViewStart.cshtml

Now Deleted the Controllers Folder of the Root Project.

Now our Main project is Sorted and Things are more readable.

Deleted ScafoldingReadMe.txt from the main project.

---------------------------------------------------------------
_ViewStart.cshtml under the views of both the Areas.

@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}
