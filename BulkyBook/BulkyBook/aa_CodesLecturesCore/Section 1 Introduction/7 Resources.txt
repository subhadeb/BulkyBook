He advertesised his own website

Gone to
https://www.dotnetmastery.com/

Looked for
Complete guide to ASP.NET Core MVC (Latest v3.1)

We have the link to live preview for his bulky book portal.

Below is the link to Github code
https://github.com/bhrugen/BulkyBook

On Click of Course Content 8MB Files were being downloaded. The file was course_9.zip. On extracting that there were Attachments and Slides.

The Attachments were there for individual sections.(Mostly I have downloaded them from Udemy).


The images would be there that we will use.

Now navigated to his github page.

We have the commits for all the lectures.

If some of our code will not work say for example Section 19 - Order Details View Part 1. We can click that and would be able to view the codes.


We can take out that code and compare with our code may be use a comparer and quickly solve the error. 


So all the codes in the lectures will have a commit.

Also in his github page, there are many other projects created by him.

BookListRazor is also there in his profile repositories.
