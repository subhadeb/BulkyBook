Now we are on the final step of our project and we will deploy our project on Azure.

I am not sure if I will be able to deploy the Portal because I have already used my 30Days free trial 2 Years back.

Signed in with my office account.

Clicked Start For Free button twice.

It opened portal.azure.

Next QuickStart Center - Ignored it.

Now opened Visual Studio. We will publish from VS.

Right click on the BulkyBook Project and clicked Publish.

A new Popup came, With the first option Azure selected.

Clicked Next, Now selected Azure App Services(Windows).

It asked to re enter credentials.


Now From the bottom selected Create a new Azure App Service.

Selected the Name as BulkyBookSD, 
Selected the Subscription as Free Trial
Kept the other two as default.

Clicked Create.

Clicked Finish

Now from Service Dependencies, selected Configure sql server database. Then Selected Azure SQL Database, Next By default it selected BulkyBook_db. changed to BulkyBookDB

Selected the Database Server name as bulkybookdbserversd

Selected admin username as 
adminuser

Set password as Admin123*

Clicked create. Thre were some errors in created gave a try again. This time selected Database connection string name as Win10DefaultConnection.

Selected admin username as 
adminuser

Set password as Admin123*

It created the connection string as 
Data Source=tcp:bulkybookdbserversd.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=BulkyBook_db;User Id=adminuser@bulkybookdbserversd;Password=Admin123*

We can see three things will be created:
1. Azure SQL SErver
2. SQL Server
3. App Service 

After all the configuration, we can see the site url.

Next he opened some settings, in which we selected the below:

Configuration: Release
Target Framework: netcoreapp3.1
Deployment Mode: Frameworkd-Dependent
Target Runtime: Portalble.

Then clicked save. and clicked Publish button. I got some error.

Now he opened BulkyBook project with the azure website Url, logged in as admin user. He can see all the tabs as well.

To test the application he created a category and it was saved. So with this our deployment to azure is done.

I was not able to run the solution in the server.
